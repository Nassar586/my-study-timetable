# HTML Study Schedule Page

This is a simple HTML project that displays a structured table to track lectures, progress, and study time.  
The table helps visualize your academic plan and stay organized during your study journey.

## Features
- Organized table layout for lectures.
- Sections for tracking time and completion.
- Clean and simple design using only HTML.
- Motivational messages included in the layout.

## Purpose
This project was created to practice basic HTML structure and layout, and to build a personal study schedule page.

## Preview
You can open the HTML file in your browser to see how it works.

## Future Plans
I plan to improve this page using CSS and JavaScript to make it more interactive and stylish.
